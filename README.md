# RoomConundrum

Game Made for Epic GameJam 2021

The theme for the Jam was "Running Out Of Space"
We decided to make a game where you are literally Running Out Of Space to go and stumbled upon the idea to create a game where you just have to get out of the room.

The player has tiles to move around the room but the tile the player leaves get elevated and player cant go there again and whenever the player moves to a tile randomly a tile adjacent to it will get destroyed making the lesser space for the player to go from.
